#FEWD Week # 6: Rock-Paper-Scissors

---

####This Assignment comes in two modes: "Mellow Mode" and "Exploration Mode".

####Mellow Mode (Less time intensive, starter provided)

This version of the assignment has you building the JavaScript functionality based on the provided starter code.  The starter code itself contains a guideline for what the interactions for each state of the game will look like, which should help inform your pseudocode.

####Exploration mode (More time intensive, no starter code)

This version of the assignment is for those who are looking for more of a challenge and have the time to start the project completely from scratch.  This is good practice for what you will eventually be doing with your Final Projects.  You are of course welcome to look at the starter code, but can choose how much of it you pull from.

**NOTE**: If you choose to start from scratch, you may want to peek in the starter code at how we are generating a randomized computer choice.

###Description 

All of your hard work coding interactive functionality for CitiPix has alerted the attention of a local game development shop that has a BRILLIANT IDEA: an analog-to-digital interpretation of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where users can play against a computer opponent (yes, not terribly unique, but they were so excited about the idea we didn't have the heart to break the news to them that this exists).

Be sure to start out with pseudocode so you have a list of TODOs to help guide your implementation process (you may want to revise the pseudocode from our first day of JS), and don't forget some of the debugging strategies we discussed this week!

###Real-World Applications


- Write pseudocode before writing any JavaScript, in order to demonstrate an understanding of interactive programming theory
- Use complex conditional statements to implement game logic
- Revisit applications and code you've written in the past to find solutions to problems you've already solved

###Technical Requirements 

- Bind a `click` listener and event handler to each image (rock, paper, or scissors)
- Use a variable to keep track of the computer's (randomly generated) choice and use a variable to keep track of the user's choice
- Use ```if/else if/else ``` conditionals to control the flow of your application
- Update the DOM after the user makes their choice and display the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the results of the game; the three images should be hidden when the results are displayed
- When the user is done playing a round, they should be given the opportunity to play again (if you are using the starter code, bind a `click` listener and handler to the button that reads "Play Again?")
- Initiating a new game (for example: clicking on Play Again button) should reveal the three image choices again, generate a new random choice for the computer, and hide the results from the previous game 
- Display your pseudocode as Javascript comments

####Bonus

- Use variables to keep track of how many games the user won and how many the computer won within a session, and display that data to the page
- Change the style of each image as you are hovering over it so that the user receives feedback about their interaction (example: change border color)

###Evaluation / Submission


Students should create a new folder and GitHub repository (for example: "rock-paper-scissors"). When ready for evaluation they should push their code to that repository. Instructional team should evaluate against the solution code and the student's use of technical elements. They will provide a numeric grade on a scale: does not meet expectations (0); meets expectations (1); exceeds expectations (2).  The maximum possible score on this assignment is 16/16. Bonus materials are completely optional.
