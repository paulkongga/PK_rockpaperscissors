#FEWD Week #6 Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors

---


###Description


All of your hard work coding interactive functionality for CitiPix has alerted the attention of a local game development shop that has a BRILLIANT IDEA: an analog-to-digital interpretation of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where users can play against a computer opponent (yes, not terribly unique, but they were so excited about the idea we didn't have the heart to break the news to them that this exists).

| Technical Requirements                                                                                                                                                                                 | Does Not Meet Expectations (0) | Meets Expectations (1) | Exceeds Expectations (2) |
| Bind a `click` listener and event handler to each image (rock, paper, or scissors) |                                |                        |                          |
| Use a variable to keep track of the computer's (randomly generated) choice and use a variable to keep track of the user's choice                                                                                              |                                |                        |                          |
| Use ```if/else if/else ``` conditionals to control the flow of your application                                                                                                                                                |                                |                        |                          |
| Update the DOM after the user makes their choice and display the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the results of the game; the three images should be hidden when the results are displayed                                                                                                                                                 |                                |                        |                          |
| When the user is done playing a round, they should be given the opportunity to play again (if you are using the starter code, bind a `click` listener and handler to the button that reads "Play Again?")                                                                                                                                                       |                                |                        |                          |
| Initiating a new game (for example: clicking on Play Again button) should reveal the three image choices again, generate a new random choice for the computer, and hide the results from the previous game                                                                                                                                           |                                |                        |                          |
| Use ```if/else if/else ``` conditionals to control the flow of your application                                                                                                                        |                                |                        |                          |
| Display your pseudocode as Javascript comments                                                                                                                                                        |                                |                        |                          |
